program to keep track of cricket (darts game) live games

I started playing lots of Dart games with my brother in the last couple of months. For the standard 501 game we already have a program to keep track of our scores and statistics. We wanted to start some other Dart variations like Cricket and didn't find a suitable program. So I suggested to build one for us. I used python with tkinter for the GUI. All games get tracked and saved into a JSON file. We can create new player profiles if friends come over so they don't mess up with out stats. :D
We started playing with this program last week and I implement features that we feel are needed. Here's a quick look at the GUI.
